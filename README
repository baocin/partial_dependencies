Creates a dependency graph of all your views and partials. It parses all your views in app/views and extracts all "render :partial" calls. This information is used to generate a graph that shows which view uses which partial (which itself may use other partials).

Once the data has been extracted it is used to generate a graphical representation using GraphViz [1]. It is saved as RAILS_ROOT/partial_dependencies.png.

Installation
------------

Install via

script/plugin install git://github.com/msales/partial_dependencies

into your Rails application

Usage
-----

This plugin is basically just a rake task. If you run

rake partial_dependencies:generate_picture

it will generate a file called partial_dependencies.png (provided that Graphviz is installed) in your RAILS_ROOT.
